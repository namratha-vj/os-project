## This is a simple terminal lock program in Windows batch scripting. Here is an explanation of what each line does:

```
@echo off
```

This turns off command echoing, so the commands themselves are not printed to the terminal.

```
echo Welcome to Terminal Lock!
```

Prints a welcome message.

``` 
echo Please set a password to lock the terminal.
```

Prompts the user to set a password.

```
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
```

Enables delayed environment variable expansion. This allows using !VAR! syntax to get variable values instead of %VAR% which evaluates immediately. Needed later.

```
:prompt_for_password
``` 

Labels a section of code as prompt_for_password.

```
set /p "PASSWORD=Enter password: " 
```

Prompts user to enter a password and stores it in PASSWORD variable.

```
echo.
```

Prints a blank line.

```
set /p "PASSWORD2=Confirm password: "
```

Prompts user to re-enter password for confirmation and stores in PASSWORD2 variable.

```
if not "!PASSWORD!" == "!PASSWORD2!" (
   echo Passwords do not match. Please try again.
   goto prompt_for_password
)
```

Compares PASSWORD and PASSWORD2. If they do not match, prints error and goes back to prompt_for_password label.

```
echo Terminal locked. Enter your password to unlock.
``` 

Prints message that terminal is now locked.

```
:lock_terminal 
```

Labels a section of code as lock_terminal.

```
set /p "ENTERED_PASSWORD=Enter password: "
```

Prompts user to enter password to unlock.

```
if not "!ENTERED_PASSWORD!" == "!PASSWORD!" (
   echo Incorrect password. Try again.
   goto lock_terminal
)
```

Compares ENTERED_PASSWORD to original PASSWORD. If no match, prints error and goes back to lock_terminal prompt.

```
echo Terminal unlocked.
```

If password matches, prints terminal unlocked message.

```
endlocal
``` 

Ends delayed variable expansion.

So in summary, it prompts for a password, stores and validates it, then locks the terminal until the correct password is entered again.

## Here is an explanation of what each line in the file properties batch script does batch script does:
```
@echo off  
```

Turns off command echoing so batch commands are not printed.

```
echo Welcome to File Properties Viewer!
```

Prints a welcome message.

```
if "%~1" == "" (
  echo Usage: %~nx0 <file_name>
  exit /b 1
)
```

Checks if first argument (%1) is empty. If so, prints usage message and exits with error code 1.

```
echo File Properties for: %~1
```

Prints message with name of file to view properties for.

``` 
echo ----------------------
```

Prints separator line.

```
dir %~1
```

Runs the dir command to print a directory listing for the file.

```
echo ---------------------- 
```

Prints another separator line.

```
file %~1
```

Runs the file command to print detailed file properties and metadata.

So in summary:

- It checks for a file name argument 
- Prints some headers
- Uses dir and file commands to print info about the file
- Exits with error if no file specified

This allows quickly viewing properties and metadata for a file by just passing the file name to the batch script.
